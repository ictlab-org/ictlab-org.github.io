## Arief Karfianto's Page

Hi, 

I'm Arief, a solution architect, system analyst, system administrator and developer. I've been working for Indonesian Government since 2009 in Information and Communication Technology area. I've been involved in various projects including [Indonesia Open Data Portal](https://data.go.id), [National Complaint Handling System](https://www.lapor.go.id), and [Innovation Management System](https://inovasi.setneg.go.id).

I'm passionate about IT Strategic Planning, IT Security, DevOps, Open Source Software, Web Development, and Software Testing.

In the area of web development, I developed various applications for internal use and national level. They include Employee Attendance System, Electronic Meeting System, and National Program Monitoring System.

During my study in Australia, I worked as a casual tutor for Web Technology at the University. I was also active in IT Division of Indonesia Student Association in Australia (PPIA). I believe that sharing knowledge to others is fun and leads to deeper understanding on the topics. That motivates me to write articles in my blog and speak at IT seminars.
